# SCiPNET Terminal
v1.0.0 - BETA
*Let me know if there are any errors, bugs, or glitches!*

SCiPNET is meant to be a fun way to see what a SCP Foundation Personnel member would see when trying to access SCP Files and more on.

Currently, there are only 4 - 5 SCPs accessible. Please suggest SCPs or other things from the SCP wiki I should add.

If I don't respond to your suggestion in 2  - 3 days, please send me a friend request on Discord and wait 3 days for me to respond. (CodedSomething#8969). If I still don't respond, just wait for me to check. I am usually busy working on other stuff so. But I eventually will.

This idea for a terminal comes from the terminal in SCP - 2317 and all the logins are from SCP - 2317.

If you need help, look at the terminal commands!

Below are important information to be able to use the terminal.
